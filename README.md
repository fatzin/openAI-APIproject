# Open AI - API

## Tried to retrieve text-model-003 API into building my own ChatGPT3

It seems that OpenAI API keys are with some problem that doesn't allow us to get information, it's causing error 429 (too many requests) even tough it shows that it's never been used

If the API was working it should respond correctly
